## dapp-test

Simple dapp to serve as an example for dappy. If you do not have web application you want to turn as a dapp, you can start with this one.

### how it works

This repo is only a very simple repo with one JS file, one HTML and one CSS file. Those three files compose the dapp :). You'll see that the JS code tests some behaviour and security features.

It is built using [dappy-cli](https://github.com/fabcotech/dappy-cli) which is the only dependancy of the project. If you want to know how to build you manifest, add libraries (JS or CSS), push it to the blockchain, and load it in dappy, check out [dappy-cli](https://github.com/fabcotech/dappy-cli) documentation.
